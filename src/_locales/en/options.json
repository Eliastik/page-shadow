This allows users to disable the inversion of colored elements while enabling entire page inversion, providing an alternative dark mode to the Increase contrast function;</li><li>Added the ability to adjust the filter intensity for the Attenuate colors function;</li><li>Colored text elements are now detected by Page Shadow. They are thus taken into account by the various functions managing colored elements: Increase contrast, Invert colors, and Attenuate colors;</li><li>When opening a new page, the Decrease brightness and Blue light reduction filter features are now applied faster to prevent the appearance of a potentially unpleasant flash, thanks to performance optimization;</li><li>The algorithm detecting images containing text/logos or other dark elements has been revised and improved: it is much more effective and efficient. It is now enabled by default in this version. To take advantage of this feature, you need to enable the Invert colors > Selective function so that detected images are inverted, making them more readable on a dark background (more details in README file);</li><li>Special attention was paid to optimizing the performance of the extension: it now adapts to the device's performance and the complexity of web pages for the page analysis engine. The number of elements analyzed automatically adjusts based on the context for better performance. Other optimizations have also been made, significantly improving the extension’s performance  (more details in README file);</li><li>Fixed issues with Cloud archiving of Page Shadow settings: in some cases, archiving could fail due to the chunking algorithm used by Page Shadow. The algorithm has been corrected, resolving these issues. Existing Cloud archives are not affected;</li><li>Added 5 additional preset slots (bringing the total to 15) and 5 additional custom theme slots (bringing the total to 10);</li><li>The extension now detects elements where a filter was applied but, due to certain changes, the filter no longer needs to be applied. Filters are now properly removed from the element in this case;</li><li>Gradient-colored backgrounds are now detected by the extension;</li><li>The advanced options interface has been revamped, with options now grouped by category;</li><li>Fixed other bugs and technical improvements (more details in README file).</li></ul>",
