* Official website: http://eliastiksofts.com/page-shadow

This is the source code for the extension Page Shadow, compatible with Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge. This extension uses the WebExtensions technology via the Browser API (more infos : https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/Add-ons/WebExtensions ).

Page Shadow is a dark mode extension. It includes a series of tools to improve the reading of web pages in a dark environment.

It allows you:

- To increase the contrast of the pages, that is to say to reinforce the dark tones of the pages: the extension transforms the design of any site into a "dark mode" theme;
- To decrease the brightness of the pages;
- To invert the colors of images or entire pages;
- To attenuate the colors of images;
- To enable a night mode (applies an orange filter on the pages to reduce the blue light emitted by the screen).

Page Shadow has many settings to personalize your extension: settings adapted to each site, automatic enable/disable, etc.

* Improved display of the Increase page contrast function on most websites:
    - Transparent backgrounds are now automatically detected (they were previously colored which could hide certain elements of websites), without going through the filters feature;
    - Fixed detection of background images;

    - Fixed Cloud archiving: settings are splitted into several items to avoid a quota per item overrun error;
    - Fixed a bug with the disabling of Page Shadow on certain websites accessed from Google on Chrome: in the event that Google highlighted a text in the page, the Page Shadow disabling feature for the page didn't work ("#:~:text=" was added at the end of the URL by Google);

Filters allow, based on rules, to improve the display of websites when the following options are enabled: Increase page contrast or Invert colors. This advance significantly improves the display of some websites when Page Shadow is enabled. This feature can also improve the performance of Page Shadow on some websites. These filters are updated daily from Internet sources. The lists provided by default are downloaded from the eliastiksofts.com website (the extension developer's website).

Filters are updated automatically;
* Addition of the possibility of defining a list of sites/pages where to automatically enable a preset: it's possible to define this list using checkboxes available in the extension menu, or by defining a list manually (the syntax is the same as the feature to disable a website/a page, and supports regular expressions and wildcards);
* It's now possible to apply the presets using keyboard shortcuts (to be configured manually);

To install gulp with npm, run the following command:
````
npm i -g gulp
````
Git clone the repository and cd to the project directory (or download it directly from Github):
